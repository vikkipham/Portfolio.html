    <h1>Objective</h1>
    <p>
        As I continue to strengthen my interpersonal skills and gain new insight into the field of psychology, I seek to work with a team aiming to facilitate a client 
        centred approach by investigating various dimensions of well being within relationships (more broadly speaking, are investigating norms of positive psychology). 
        I am very open minded and love connecting my newfound knowledge in various domains to come to knowledgeable conclusions and generate new discussion. If you would 
        like to learn more, message me here, or email me at vikki.pham@mail.utoronto.ca,
